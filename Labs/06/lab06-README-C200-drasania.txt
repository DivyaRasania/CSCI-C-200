1. The parts of Lab Task 06 that you have completed, and how you completed them
→ I completed all parts of the lab.
  For even_numbers(), I used for loop and modulus operator to find the even numbers if the result is 1.
  For star_pattern(), I used while loop. I set a varible with '*' and multiplied it with the number of count and incremented count by 1 each time while loop ran.
  For print_num(), I used while loop as well. I checked if num is greater then or equal to 0, printed num, and decremented num by 1.
  And for dict_example(), I used items() method and for loop on dict to look at all the items in dictionary and checked if the votes of each person is greater then max_votes and if they were I would set it as the max_votes. Then I would pull name of the person with max_votes using indexing.

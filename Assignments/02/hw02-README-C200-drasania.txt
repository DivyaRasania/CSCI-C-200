Task A:
1. toThePower()
number, number -> number
2. quadruplicate()
string -> string
3. subtract()
number, number -> number
4. overlap()
string, string -> string
5. multiplicate()
string, number -> string

Task E:
1. l
2. b
3. a
4. w
5. It will give a 'IndexError'
6. It will give count from the end of the string and give me the letter of that index (eg. -1 index is 'z')
7. It will give a 'TypeError'

Task F:
1. A function is defined as 'def function_name():'. In between (), you can add any numbers of parameters. After that, your function body should be indented so let python know that, that is the part of the function. In the end you can add 'return' to return the value processed inside the function.
2. First is parameters which are used to give functions some variables to process, and other is return which are used to return some value processed by that function.
3. No
4. Unlimited
5. Only one. Because as soon as you return a value from inside a function, python will ignore the rest of the code.
6. Arguments are something you pass to functions (eg. in print(2+2), the '2+2' is an argument given to function) and parameters are something the functions uses to process something (eg. in print(2+2), function will take '2+2' as parameters, processes it, give the output 4)
7. It allows better code readbility so if anyone else is to work on your code, they can understand what was your thought process and if put inside a function, python will use that as a documation on how the function works.
